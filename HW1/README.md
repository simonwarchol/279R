# [Tier 1] Programming HW0: Make a To-Do App with just HTML, CSS, and JS

## Simon Warchol
**Note:** Much of the template HTML is from my HW0 submission
### How to Run

1) First create a database on `mongodb.com` taking note of the connection string
2) Create a `.env` file in the `HW1` directory with the following contents:

```
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<database-url>/todoapp
PORT=4000
```

3) Install Node and `npm`
4) Install dependencies with `npm install`
5) Run the server with `npm start`
6) Access the app at `http://localhost:7070`
