## Simon Warchol

**Note:** Built using MUI and the Vite create-react-app template.

### How to Run

1) Install:
    - `cd doodle-clone`)
    - `npm i`)
2) Run:
    - `npm run dev`)
3) Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` in your browser (check the terminal for the correct port if there are issues)

4) **Note:** This site is intended to be displayed in full-screen on a desktop/laptop. It is not optimized for mobile.
### Key Distinguishing Characteristics 
In doodle, user availability is visualized and input as a grid, with each row representing a participant and each column representing a time slot. 
The user can then click on a cell checkbox to indicate their availability for that time slot.
At the top of each column the number of participants who are available for that time slot is displayed.
