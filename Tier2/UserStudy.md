# Tier2: Design a study to compare When2Meet and Doodle
## Simon Warchol

### User Study
When2Meet and Doodle are both systems that help users schedule meetings. They allow users to input their availability and browse the availability of others to find an optional time to meet. However, they offer significantly different software concepts. Here we evaluate two specific parts of these systems: how well they allow users to input their own availability and how well they convey the availability of others. 
#### Participants and Settings
Both When2Meet and Doddle are popular systems; many members of the Harvard Community and the general public have used one or both to plan work or social events. As such, so long as a participant is aware of the concept of time and a daily calendar and is capable of using a computer, they can participate. They will access both websites on a computer they are comfortable using. 
#### Tasks
##### T1: Input User Availability
A participant will receive a list of 1-hour time periods in 3 days in the following form:

```
Mon Jan  14 1pm - 2pm
Mon Jan  14 3pm - 4pm
Tue Jan  13 2pm - 3pm
Wed Jan  16 2pm - 3pm
Wed Jan  16 3pm - 4pm
Wed Jan  16 4pm - 5pm
```
They must input these times into the system and then press submit.

##### T2: Understanding Input Availability
Using the visual encoding of participant availability provided by each system, a user will answer questions of the following two forms.

1. How many potential 1 hr meeting times exist in this 3-day time span?
2. How many participants are available on `Wed Jan  16` from `2pm - 3pm`? (these will be randomized)

#### Procedure
In both tasks, a user will press a standardized `Submit` button upon completion. This button will be the same and in the same place in both interfaces. Similarly, the values for Task 2 will be input into the same text input field in both systems. We will evaluate **how long users take to complete each task** and **how accurate they are**.
